Shell and I sat down to draw up a M-V-A model of the application. We did this both on whiteboard (see included image file)
and verbally, establishing what methods (behaviors) and objects we would implement.
After several drafts, we finally agreed upon a de-coupled model where the model and view 
did not communicate with one another. We needed a way for the Counter object to "tell" 
the adapter what state it was in, either at rest, incrementing or decrementing. Then based on that state,
we could determine what methods the Activity was going to send out to View, and call. 

We regrettably did write the units tests before starting programming the application, and
had difficulty writing the tests after the fact. That is the one thing we would do differently in
future projects. 

While GitHub and version control in general is now the norm, Ron found it easier to sit with Shell
and program side by side adhering to the XP practice of pair programming, and taking turns at the computer while
the other tested the app on their mobile device, added to the whiteboard, or performed code review to catch errors. 
Because we scrapped our entire project code very late in the development cycle, we found it easier
to code this way instead of working remotely using version control.

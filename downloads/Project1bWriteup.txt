Project 1b Writeup

We both found it would have been more effective to create a model first before coding began.
We did do some white-boarding during the coding process that looked very similar to a State
Transition Diagram before we even knew such diagrams existed. I think that speaks to how
a diagram is easily mapped to the MVA structure, i.e. MVA is an implicit diagram on its own. 

After creating our diagram we realized that almost all of the complexity of the timer 
is captured in the adapter, rather than the model. The adapter is acting as an adapter and 
a timer maintaining states. We were stubborn and should have created a timer interface or 
class to capture new functionality and reduce the amount of extra work handled by the adapter.

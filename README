Project Name: Timer 

Authors: Xiao (Shell) Yan & Ron Giambalvo 

Description: This application runs on an Android-compatible mobile device. The Timer application behaves as follows:

*The timer always displays the remaining time.
*Initially, the timer is stopped and the (remaining) time is zero.
*If the button is pressed when the timer is stopped, the time is incremented by one up to a preset maximum of 99. (The button acts as an increment button.)
*If the time is greater than zero and three seconds elapse from the most recent time the button was pressed, then the timer beeps once and starts running.
*While running, the timer subtracts one from the time for every second that elapses.
*If the timer is running and the button is pressed, the timer stops and the time is reset to zero. (The button acts as a cancel button.)
*If the timer is running and the time reaches zero by itself (without the button being pressed), then the timer stops and the alarm starts beeping continually and indefinitely.
*If the alarm is sounding and the button is pressed, the alarm stops sounding; the timer is now stopped and the (remaining) time is zero. (The button acts as a stop button).
